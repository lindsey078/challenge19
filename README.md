Description

The Tech Quiz Application is a web-based quiz platform built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. This application allows users to take a ten-question quiz to test their tech knowledge. At the end of the quiz, users can view their score and restart the quiz.

This project focuses on enhancing the application with Cypress testing to ensure reliability through component and end-to-end (E2E) testing.
